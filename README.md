# Challenges by Sir Sibtain PIAIC
## 1. Make a function of average to calculate the average of unknown/unlimited nos of parameters using rest operator.
## 2. Given a time in-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
## 3. Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
## 4. Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each frac∆üon on a new line with 6 places after the decimal. Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with an absolute error of up to 10-4 are acceptable.
